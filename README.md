# My First ML Linear Regression Application

Welcome, welcome! This is my first application of my newfound ML knowledge. While my previous linear regression repositories covered almost everything I need to know, here you will also find some bonus experience on missing value imputation. I simply refuse to settle for mean, median, or mode value imputation... or (heaven forbid) dropping the missing values altogether. Blasphemy!

That being said, I extensively explore the more advanced alternatives here and provide comparisons for all methods to put my obsessive mind at ease. I will also note that my results showing the best imputation methods for this problem are not conclusive (in any context). This isn't the main goal of the repository, and is instead more of an additional curiosity.

To any who may be interested, I encourage you to take a look, follow my diary-esque markdown notes, and see how my efforts have paid off thus far.
