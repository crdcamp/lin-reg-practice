# My First ML Linear Regression Application

Welcome, welcome! This is my first application of my newfound ML knowledge. The main goal here is to establish familiarity with linear model creation and missing value imputation. **In no way shape or form is this repository meant for the development of a good model**. None of these results are conclusive and only serve as a sort of proof of concept. More advanced methods with a focus on model performance are explored in the next repository.

To any who may be interested, I encourage you to take a look, follow my diary-esque markdown notes, and see how my efforts have paid off thus far.
