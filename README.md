# My First ML Linear Regression Application

Welcome, welcome! This is my first application of my newfound ML knowledge. While my previous linear regression repositories covered almost everything I need to know, here you will also find some bonus experience on missing value imputation. I simply refuse to settle for mean, median, or mode value imputation... or (heaven forbid) dropping the missing values altogether. Blasphemy!

That being said, I extensively explore the more advanced alternatives here and provide comparisons for all methods to put my obsessive mind at ease.

To any who may be interested, I encourage you to take a look, follow my diary-esque markdown notes, and see how my efforts have paid off thus far.
