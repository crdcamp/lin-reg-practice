    "A bit about LightGBM:\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM, short for **Light Gradient-Boosting Machine**, is developed by Microsoft and based on **decision tree** algorithms and used for ranking, classification, and other machine learning tasks. The development focus is on performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, in gradient descent, one uses th whole set of data to calculate the valley's slopes. However, this commonly used method assumes that every data point is equally informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, Gradient-Based One-Side Samping (GOSS), doesn't rely on that assumption. Instead, it treats data points with smaller gradients (shallower slopes) as less informative by randomly dropping them. This is intended to filter out data which may have been influenced by noise, allowing the model to more accurately model the underlying relationships in the data."

    "## Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a validation set, you can use early stopping to find the optimal number of boosting rounds. Early stopping requires at least one set in `valid_sets`. If there is more than one, it will use all of them except the training data:\n",

    "The model will train until the validation score stops improving. Validation score needs to improve at least every `stopping_rounds` to continue training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index of iteration that has the best performance will be saved in the `best_iteration` field if early stopping logic is enables by setting `early_stopping` callback. Note that `train()` will return a model from the best iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works with both metrics to minimize (L2, log loss, etc.) and to maximize (NDCG, AUC, etc.). Note that if you specify more than one evaluation metric, all of them will be used for early stopping. However, you can change this behavior and make LightGBM check only the first metric for early stopping by passing `first_metric_only=True` in `early_stopping` callback constructor.\n",

    "Very nice.\n",
